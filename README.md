This is a simple demonstration of backbone.js in the form a of a dumb notetaking app.

The server is sinatra so you will need to install ruby and the sinatra, sinatra-contrib, and json gems.

once you have all of that execute

ruby app.rb 

Then you need to navigate a browser to the the url it specifies.

The app just reads a json file and lists the notes in it.

If you click on a note you will see a note detail view.

If you click on a note detail view you will see an edit view.
